# Sequences

## Arithmetic Sequence

An **arithmetic seuqnces** is a sequence in which each successive term has a common difference

An arithmetic sequence can be defined explicity with the formula
$$a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$$

Or recursively through the formula

$$a_1=x$$
$$a_n=a_{n-1}+d$$

## Geometric Sequence

A **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which each successive term has a common ratio

A geometric sequence can be defined explicity with the formula
$$a_n=a_1+(r)^{n-1}$$

Or recursively though the formula

$$a_1=x$$
$$a_n=a_{n-1}\times r$$

## Fibonacci Sequence

$$a_1=1$$
$$a_2=1$$
$$a_n=a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}$$
