1. Scatterplots and Correlation
    * **Scatterplots** display the relation between two quantitative variables measured on the same individuals
        * x is the **expalatory variable** while y is the **response variable**
        * When describing scatterplots, mention the **direction**, **form**, **strength**, and **outliers**
            * Direction: If there is a clear direction, it either has a **positive association** or a **negative association**
            * Form: Are the points in a straight pattern or do they curve?
            * Strength: how close the points lie in a straight line
        * The **correlation coefficient r** measures the strength and direction between two variables
2. Least-Squares Regression
    * A **regression line** describes how y changes with respect to x. This line can be used to predict the value of y given an x value
    * **Extrapolation** is when x values outside the range of the data is used. This should be avoided since it can provide inaccurate results
    * **Least-squares regression lines** are the most common method of fitting a line to a scatterplot
        * This line minimizes the sum of the residuals squared
    * **Residuals** are the difference between the observed and predicted values of y ($y-\hat{y}$)
        * A **residual plot** can be used to indicate if a linear model is appropriate if there is no pattern in the graph
    * The **standard deviation of residuals s** measures the typical size of the prediction errors
    * The **coefficient of determination $r^2$** is the fraction of the variation in y that is accounted for by the line
