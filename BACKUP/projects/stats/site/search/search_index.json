A  two way table  organizes data about two categorical variables for the same individuals.  The  marginal distribution  is one of the categorical variables over the total number of individuals. It looks at a single variable  The  conditional distribution  compares the value of one variable to the value of another    A  segmented bar graph  or a  side by side bar graph  can be used to display conditional distributions    Displaying Quantitative Data with Graphs  dotplots ,  stemplots , and  histograms  show the distribution of a quantitative variable  Shape ,  center , and  spread  describes the overall pattern.  Outliers  shows departures from the pattern.    Some distributions are  symmetric ,  left-skewed , or  right-skewed    Describing Quantitative Data with Numbers  The  mean  and  median  describe the center of a distribution.  The  standard deviation  and  IQR  are measures of spread  The mean and standard deviation should only be used with roughly symmetric distributions",
