	* Sans-serif have a cleaner and simpler look
		* More neutral
		* Clean
		* Simple
		* Modern websites
	* Serif has small extensions on each letter
		* Traditional purposes
		* Storytelling

# Color

1. Use a single base color
2. Use color to draw attention (to elements of importance like a button)
3. Never use black as part of your design
4. Choose colors wisely
	* Red: power, passion, strength
	* Orange: attention, cherful, creativity, friendlyness
	* Green: nature, life, money
	* Blue: patience, peace, trust, stability, honor
	* Purple: Power, royalty, mystery, wisdom

# Images

## Putting text on an image
1. Put text directly on an image
	* Only works if image is dark and text is light
2. Overlay image with a color (to make it darker)
	* Could use gradients
3. Put text in a caption box
	* Box should be opaque
4. Blur image
5. Floor fade
	* Image fades to black from top to bottom
	* Text is on bottom

# Icons
1. Use icons to list features/steps
2. Use icons for actions and links
	* Icons should be recognizable
	* Label the icons
3. Shouldn't take center stage

## Formats
* **Static** images
	* Can become blury with larger resolutions
* **Vector** icon fonts
	* scalable for any resolution and won't get blury

# Spacing and Layout
1. Use whitespace
	* Put between elements
	* Put between groups of elements
	* Put between website's sections
	* Don't exaggerate
2. Define hierarchy
	* Whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of a website
	* Define where you want audience to look first
	* Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message
	* Use whitespace to build that flow
