# Mathmatical Induction

1. Show that the formula holds true for n=1
2. Subsitute n with k
3. Substitute k with k+1 and solve

## Examples

### Example One
Show that \(n^2+n\) is divisible by 2 for all natural numbers \(n\)

1. Holds true for n=1
	$$a_1=1^2+1$$
	$$a_1=2$$
	$$\frac{2}{2} = 1$$
2. Assume n=k
	$$k^2+k$$
3. Solve for k+1
	$$(k+1)^2+(k+1)$$
	$$k^2+2k+1+k+1$$
	$$k^2+k+2k+2$$
	$$k^2+k+2(k+1)$$
	$$\frac{k^2+k}{2} = 1$$
	$$\frac{2(k+1)}{2} = k+1$$
