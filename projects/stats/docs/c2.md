1. Describing Location in a Distribution
    * **Percentiles** and **z-scores** can be used to measure an individual's location
        * The percentile is the percent of the distribution that is at or below the value of that observation
        * The z-score is how many standard deviations x is from the mean
    * A **cumulative relative frequency graph** shows the accumulating percent of observations as you move through the classes.
    * Data can be *transformed** by adding/subtracting and multiplying/dividing
        * (+) and (-) by b 
            * Center (mean and median) and location (quartiles and percentiles) changes by b
            * Measures of spread and shape do not change
        * (x) or (/) by b
            * Center, location, and spread change by a factor of b
            * Shape does not change
2. Density Curves and Normal Distributions
    * **density curves** can describe the overall pattern of a distribution.
        * Always is on or above the horizontal axis
        * Always has an area of one
        * The $\mu$ of a density curve is the balancing point
        * The median divides the area under the curve in half
        * The $\sigma$ is at the POI
    * A **normal distribution** is described by a symmetric density curve called the **normal curve**
        * It is described by N($\mu$,$\sigma$)
        * A normal distribution obey's the **68-95-99.7** rule
    * A **standard normal distribution** has a $\mu$ of 0 and a $\sigma$ of 1
    * A **normal probability plot** can tell you if a distribution is normal

# Calculator Functions
**normCdf(lower bound, upper bound, $\mu$, $\sigma$)** tells you the area under a normal curve (in other words the probability from [a,b])

**invNorm(area to the left, $\mu$, $\sigma$)** tells you the value for a given area

**normPdf(x value, $\mu$, $\sigma$)** tells you the probability at a given point $\text{normCdf(a,b)}=\int_{a}^{b} \text{normPdf(x) } dx$
