Strength: how close the points lie in a straight line The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction between two variables Least-Squares Regression A regression line describes how y changes with respect to x. This line can be used to predict the value of y given an x value Extrapolation is when x values outside the range of the data is used. This should be avoided since it can provide inaccurate results Least-squares regression lines are the most common method of fitting a line to a scatterplot This line minimizes the sum of the residuals squared Residuals are the difference between the observed and predicted values of y ( y-\\hat{y} y-\\hat{y} ) A residual plot can be used to indicate if a linear model is appropriate if there is no pattern in the graph The standard deviation of residuals s measures the typical size of the prediction errors The coefficient of determination r^2 r^2 is the fraction of the variation in y that is accounted for by the line","title":"Topcis"},{"location":"c3/#formulas","text":"\\LARGE \\hat{y}=a+bx \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE a=\\bar{y}-b\\bar{x} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE b=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE \\text{residual}=y-\\hat{y} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{\\text{residuals}^2}}{n-2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(y_i-\\hat{y})^2}}{n-2}} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE r=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum{z_xz_y}=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum{\\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{s_x}\\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{s_y}} \\\\[30pt] \\LARGE r^2=1-\\frac{\\sum{\\text{residuals}^2}}{\\sum{(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE \\hat{y}=a+bx \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE a=\\bar{y}-b\\bar{x} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE b=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE \\text{residual}=y-\\hat{y} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{\\text{residuals}^2}}{n-2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(y_i-\\hat{y})^2}}{n-2}} \\\\[20pt] \\LARGE r=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum{z_xz_y}=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum{\\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{s_x}\\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{s_y}} \\\\[30pt] \\LARGE r^2=1-\\frac{\\sum{\\text{residuals}^2}}{\\sum{(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}} \\\\[20pt]","title":"Formulas"},{"location":"c3/#terms","text":"","title":"Terms"},{"location":"c3/#review","text":"What is an approximate correlation coefficient for the following scatterplot?
